# Building-Fanorona-Game-in-C
Fanorona Implementation in C: A Two-Player Strategy Game of Capture. Coded in 2022

This project aims to write a program in C to automate the game of fanorona-tsivy. Initially, I focus on the case of player versus player. Afterwards, I try to improve the program so that a human player can play against the machine.
